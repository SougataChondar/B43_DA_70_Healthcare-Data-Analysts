# **Lung Cancer Prediction Dashboard**

## **Introduction**

The Lung Cancer Prediction Dashboard is an impactful healthcare analytics tool designed to aid early detection and risk assessment. By leveraging machine learning with a Random Forest Classifier, it provides accurate predictions based on patient data, while the interactive Streamlit dashboard enhances usability with real-time visual insights.

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in healthcare, combining data visualization, predictive analytics, and user-friendly UI to create an accessible and insightful tool. Future enhancements, such as model improvements, additional risk factors, and better UI/UX, can further increase its accuracy and usability.

Ultimately, this project highlights the importance of AI and data analytics in driving healthcare innovation, making early lung cancer detection more efficient and accessible.
